# Dicee_random
A basic Flutter dice app is a simple mobile application that generates a pair of dice images 
when a user clicks on the screen. The app's user interface typically consists of a button 
that a user can press to roll the dice and display a random pair of dice images.

The Flutter framework, which uses the Dart programming language, provides a fast and 
efficient way to build cross-platform apps for Android and iOS. The basic dice app utilizes 
the Flutter Image widget to display the dice images and the Dart math package to generate 
random numbers.

The app's structure typically includes a stateful widget that holds the state of the dice 
images, a function that generates random numbers for the dice roll, and an on-click function 
that updates the dice images when the user clicks the button.
